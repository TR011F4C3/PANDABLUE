The next generation of PÎ»NDA - the open source compilation script.

Panda Blue is a script hub - a script of a variety of different peoples scripts.
Although some scripts are already added, we are taking suggestions. We will attempt to include mostly unobfuscated scripts.

# Design
Panda Blue uses the Kavo UI Library allowing for a condensed but also feature rich experience.
