The next generation of PÎ»NDA - the open source compilation script.

Panda Blue is a pioneer of the compilation script genre - a script of a variety of different peoples scripts.
Although some scripts are already added, we are taking suggestions. We will only include unobfuscated scripts.

# Design
Panda Blue will use the Kavo UI Library allowing for a condensed but also feature rich experience.

# What if I don't want my script in Panda Blue?
Sometimes when a script is added after either a suggestion or maintainer choice, you may not be comfortable with your script being in Panda Blue. This is 100% ok and I understand why. If you want a script you own removed, please notify me on discord.
