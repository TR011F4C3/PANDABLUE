The next generation of Panda - the open source compilation script.

Panda Blue is a pioneer of the compilation script genre - a script of a variety of different peoples scripts.
Although some scripts are already added, we are taking suggestions. We will only include unobfuscated scripts.

# Design
Panda Blue will use the Kavo UI Library allowing for a condensed but also feature rich experience.

# Release Date
Panda Blue is in pre-alpha stages and won't be released until alpha stages. To be clear, it's coming out when it's ready.
